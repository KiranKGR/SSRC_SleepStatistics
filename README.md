## Overview
This repository contains the documentation and matlab scripts for generating the SSRC Polysomnography sleep statistics. The complete list of the sleep statistics and the corresponding definitions can be found in the "Polysomnography Data Extraction and Analysis Specification": [documentation](https://github.com/KiranKGR/SSRC_SleepStatistics/tree/55517b859229ea1ac1bb4316c48f47f413487214/documentation)

The Code and its description can be found in the [src](https://github.com/KiranKGR/SSRC_SleepStatistics/tree/55517b859229ea1ac1bb4316c48f47f413487214/exampledata) folder
## Requirements 
Matlab 2021 or above

## Example Data
The example data for the Marker and hypnograms txt files can be found in: [exampledata](https://github.com/KiranKGR/SSRC_SleepStatistics/tree/947ee5aa719181079ed5e1d261f63defb6295fa0/exampledata)

The data format matches the export file formats of Somnomedics PSG analysis software - Domino v3.
